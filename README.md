# Optimized Settings for PC Games

Welcome to my project, where you can find the best settings for any game! Finding the right settings for your favorites games can be a daunting task, so I have created an interactive platform that will help you optimize your gaming experience. 

This project used data from [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/) to showcase the information in an easy-to-understand format. 

I have also included images and videos to each game for a better experience overhaul. This project is user-friendly and easy to navigate. 

I hope that my project will help you optimize your gaming experience and improve your performance in your favorite games. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions. 

Happy gaming!
