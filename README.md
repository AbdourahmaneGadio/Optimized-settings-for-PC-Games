# Optimized Settings for PC Games

Welcome to my project, where you can find the best settings for any game! Finding the right settings for your favorites games can be a daunting task, so I have created an interactive platform that will help you optimize your gaming experience. 

This project used data from [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/) to showcase the information in an easy-to-understand format. 

I have also included images and videos to each game for a better experience overhaul. This project is user-friendly and easy to navigate. 

I hope that my project will help you optimize your gaming experience and improve your performance in your favorite games. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions. 

Happy gaming!

## Want to contribute ?

Create a json file in the appropriate directory. 

It must start with the first letter of the game you want to add.

```
Example: If you want to add the settings for Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales, you need to add them into the folder "M"
```

Then, write it like this template :

```json
{
  "Game": "Game's name",
  "Settings One": "What ever value",
  "Settings Two": "Another value",
  ...
}
```

With Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales, we have :

```json
{
  "Game": "Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales",
  "Anti-Aliasing": "TAA or DLAA if you have a NVIDIA GPU",
  "Texture Filtering": "8x",
  "Shadow Quality": "Medium or High",
  "Ambient Occlusion": "SSAO",
  "Screen Space Reflection": "On",
  "RT Reflection": "High Resolution / High Geometry",
  "RT Shadows": "Off",
  "Level of Detail": "High",
  "Traffic Density": "Very low",
  "Crowd Density": "Very low",
  "Hair Quality": "Medium",
  "Weather Particle Quality": "Medium"
}
```
